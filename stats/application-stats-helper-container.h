/**
 * \ingroup applicationstats
 * \brief Container of ApplicationStatsHelper instances.
 *
 * The container is initially empty upon creation. ApplicationStatsHelper
 * instances can be added into the container using attributes or class methods.
 * The following example creates a new container and adds two different
 * statistics instances:
 * \code
 *     ApplicationContainer txApps;
 *     ApplicationContainer rxApps;
 *     // ... (snip) ...
 *     Ptr<ApplicationStatsHelperContainer> stat
 *         = CreateObject<ApplicationStatsHelperContainer> ();
 *     stat->SetTraceSourceName ("Rx");
 *     stat->AddSenderApplication (app);
 *     stat->AddReceiverApplications (sinkApps);
 *     stat->AddPerSenderThroughput (ApplicationStatsHelper::OUTPUT_SCATTER_FILE);
 *     stat->AddPerReceiverThroughput (ApplicationStatsHelper::OUTPUT_SCATTER_FILE);
 * \endcode
 *
 * The value of the attributes and the arguments of the class methods are the
 * desired output type (e.g., scalar, scatter, histogram, files, plots, etc.).
 *
 * The output files will be named in a certain pattern using the name set in
 * the `Name` attribute or SetName() method. The default name is "stat", e.g.,
 * which will produce output files with the names such as
 * `stat-per-receiver-throughput-scalar.txt`,
 * `stat-per-receiver-delay-cdf-receiver-1.txt`, etc.
