/**
 * \ingroup nrtv
 * \brief Model application which simulates the traffic of a Near Real-Time
 *        Video (NRTV) service, i.e., a video streaming service, over TCP.
 *
 * In summary, the application works as follows. Upon start, the application
 * opens a socket and listens to connection requests from clients (NrtvTcpClient).
 * Once the request is accepted (always) and a connection is established, the
 * application begins to send a video (as a stream of packets) to the client.
 * When the transmission of the whole video is completed, the application
 * disconnects the client.
 *
 * The application maintains several workers (NrtvTcpServerVideoWorker). Each
 * worker is responsible for sending a single video for a single client.
