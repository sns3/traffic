     *               destination client) that will be utilized by the worker to
     *               send video packets
     *
     * The worker will determine the length of video using NrtvVariables class.
     * Other variables are also retrieved from this class, such as number of
     * frames per second (frame rate) and number of slices per frame.
     *
     * The first video frame starts once the server has given a permission to do so.
     * Each frame has a fixed number of slices, and each slice is preceded by a
     * random length of encoding delay. Each slice constitutes a single packet,
     * which size is also determined randomly. Each packet begins with a 24-byte
     * NrtvHeader.
     *
     * Each frame always abides to the given frame rate, i.e., the start of each
     * frame is always punctual according to the frame rate. If the transmission
     * of the slices takes longer than the length of a single frame, then the
     * remaining unsent slices would be discarded, without postponing the start
     * time of the next frame.
     *
     * Each slice sent will invoke the callback function specified using
     * SetTxCallback(). After all the frames have been transmitted, another
     * callback function, specified using SetVideoCompletedCallback(), will be
     * invoked.
