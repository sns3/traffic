 * \brief Model application which simulates the traffic of a client of a Near
 *        Real-Time Video (NRTV) service, i.e., a client accessing a video
 *        streaming service, over TCP.
 *
 * Upon start, the application sends a connection request to the destination
 * server. Once connected, the application waits for incoming video packets.
 *
 * When the server terminates the connection, the application regards it as the
 * end of a video session. At this point, the application enters the IDLE state,
 * which is a randomly determined delay that simulates the user "resting"
 * between videos (e.g., commenting or picking the next video). After the IDLE
 * timer expires, the application restarts again by sending another connection
 * request.
