/**
 * @ingroup traffic
 *
 * @brief Generate traffic to a single destination according to a CBR pattern.
 *
 * This traffic generator follows a CBR pattern: after CbrApplication::StartApplication
 * is called, CBR sending starts. The sending continues as long as applications runs.
 * This CBR traffic is characterized by the specified "data rate", "packet size" and "interval".
 *
 * Note:  When an application is started, the first packet transmission
 * occurs after given interval. The application sends a packet right after previous packet,
 * if interval is shorter than time needed for sending the packet.
 *
 * If the underlying socket type supports broadcast, this application
 * will automatically enable the SetAllowBroadcast(true) socket option.
